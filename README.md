# Game-Development-Griffith

## Brief Information for each week:

### Week 1: 

  - Create a ball obstacle course where the ball falls and uses Unity physics to reach an "end" goal. When reaching the end, update a score by 1 point.
  - Anything else you do along the way (jumping, speed ramps, force/direction changes etc) is up to you (and optional for today).
  
### Week 2-3:

  - Make a little 2D level 2) 
  - Finish your player character.  
  - It should have: 
    - jump (based on whether it detects ground below).
    - animations for running left/right (jump/fall/impact optional).
    - flipping when moving left/right camera that follows the player particle system that plays when the player moves (but NOT when the player is in the air).
    - prefab the player Spend some time tweaking the values to make sure the player feels good in your opinion, and it feels challenging but not frustrating.
    
### Week 4-5:

  - Stealth Game.
  - Create a level in Probuilder.
  - Bake a Navmesh in/on that level.
  - Create a player that is controlled using the Navmesh (suggest using a raycast to detect a mousehit for example).
  - Create enemies that will chase the player if the player gets too close, but if they do not detect the player, they will return to a patrol route Create an end goal that the player will reach to win the game.
  - Design and implement a finite state machine for your enemy(ies) NPC that take into account a number of parameters and shifts between states based on these inputs.
  
### Week 6:

  - Make a game using at least 3 unity UI elements (e.g. buttons sliders toggle etc)
  - This can be any game e.g. a platformer, sizing something to fit into a hole, a bowling game where you use buttons to lock in the strength and sliders to adjust trajectory etc.
  
### Project:

  - Use of Navmesh.
  - Use of Probuilder.
  - Enemies or NPCs with state machines.
  - Use of raycasts to detect things (can be player, enemies, pathfinding etc).
  - Use of animations/animator state machines.
  - Use of triggers/collision detection to activate or detect physics or motion.
  - Use of UI to denote score or other player-relevant information.
  - High Concept document explaining an elevator pitch for the game (imagine a Steam description, with pictures etc) references to any assets used from external sources.
  - 30 second to 1 minute trailer/gameplay video.
